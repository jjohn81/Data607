I have created two rmd files. One for using SQL lite and another one for My SQL. 

SQL Lite version:
	 creates a local db file and creates a table from R. It then loads data from R and executes few sql statments.

My Sql version
	Sql file has the SQL statements to create schema and to create two tables. It also contains sql insert staments.
	Sql file also creates a user called data607a and grants permissions.
	From R, I am executing few SQL statments to retrieve data.
